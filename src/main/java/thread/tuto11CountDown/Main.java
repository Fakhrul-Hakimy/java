import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;
/**
 * ðŸ§  This program demonstrates CountDownLatch in Java.
 *
 * - 3 worker threads represent student tasks: quiz, assignment, groupProject.
 * - The main thread waits until all 3 tasks finish using latch.await().
 * - Each thread sleeps for a random time and then counts down the latch.
 *
 * âœ… This is useful when:
 *    - You want to wait for multiple threads to complete before proceeding.
 *    - You need to ensure a task runs only *after* others are done.
 *
 * Real-world example: Wait for 3 APIs to return before combining the result.
