/**
 * ðŸ§  What is Callable in Java?
 *
 * - `Callable<V>` is a functional interface in Java (java.util.concurrent).
 * - Similar to `Runnable`, but with key differences:
 *     1. It **returns a result** (of type V).
 *     2. It can **throw checked exceptions**.
 *
 * âœ… Typical usage:
 * - Used for tasks that need to run in a separate thread and return a value.
 * - Commonly used with `ExecutorService.submit(Callable)` which returns a `Future<V>`.
 *
 * ðŸ”§ With `Future<V>`:
 * - You use `.get()` on the Future to retrieve the result of the task once it's completed.
 * - `.get()` blocks the current thread until the result is available.
 *
 * In this example:
 * - Each `HotelRoom` simulates a task that returns a random price.
 * - We submit the task to an executor and retrieve the result via Future.
